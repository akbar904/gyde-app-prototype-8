    "content": "# API and Architecture Change Summary\n\n## Major Architectural Changes \ud83d\udd04\n1. **Application Purpose Shift**\n   - Transformed from a generic app to USMLE Step 1 preparation platform\n   - New focus on educational features and progress tracking\n   - Added authentication layer for secure access\n\n2. **Core Architecture Expansion**\n   - Added services for authentication, data persistence, and progress tracking\n   - Enhanced Stacked architecture implementation\n   - Modified navigation flow to include authentication gates\n\n## New Components \u2795\n1. **Feature Modules**\n   - Authentication (`login_view.dart`, `login_viewmodel.dart`)\n   - Study Plan (`study_plan_view.dart`, `study_plan_viewmodel.dart`)\n   - Question Bank (`question_bank_view.dart`, `question_bank_viewmodel.dart`)\n   - Progress Tracking (`progress_tracking_view.dart`, `progress_tracking_viewmodel.dart`)\n\n2. **New Methods**\n   - `login()`: Authentication handling\n   - `setupStudyPlan()`: Study plan configuration\n   - `loadQuestions()`: Question bank management\n   - `trackProgress()`: Progress monitoring\n\n## Removed Components \u2796\n1. **Eliminated Features**\n   - Home module (`home_view.dart`, `home_viewmodel.dart`)\n   - Startup module (`startup_view.dart`, `startup_viewmodel.dart`)\n   - Generic app module (`app_view.dart`, `app_viewmodel.dart`)\n\n2. **Removed Methods**\n   - `incrementCounter()`\n   - `showDialog()`\n   - `showBottomSheet()`\n   - `runStartupLogic()`\n\n## Breaking Changes \u26a0\ufe0f\n1. **Navigation Flow**\n   - New authentication-first flow\n   - Required login before accessing features\n   - Modified routing structure\n\n2. **Package Identity**\n   - Changed package name to `com.com.walturn.aorteq_app`\n\n## Required Updates \ud83d\udcdd\n1. **Integration Changes**\n   - Update route references to new authentication flow\n   - Implement authentication handling in existing integrations\n   - Update dependency injection setup\n\n2. **State Management**\n   - Implement global authentication state\n   - Update protected route handling\n\n## Security Implications \ud83d\udd12\n- Added authentication layer requires proper security implementation\n- Protected routes need authentication validation\n- User data handling requires proper encryption and storage\n\n## Performance Considerations \ud83d\ude80\n- New progress tracking may impact performance\n- Question bank loading requires optimization\n- Study plan setup wizard flow needs performance monitoring\n\nThis update represents a significant architectural shift toward an educational platform with enhanced security and user tracking features. All integrations will need to be updated to accommodate the new authentication flow and feature set.",
