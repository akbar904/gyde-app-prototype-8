    "content": "### Summary of Changes\n\n#### 1. Additions (\u2795)\n- **New Components:**\n  - **LoginView** and **LoginViewModel**: Introduced for user authentication.\n  - **StudyPlanView** and **StudyPlanViewModel**: Added for setting up an initial study plan.\n  - **QuestionView** and **QuestionViewModel**: Created for displaying questions from the question bank.\n  - **ProgressDashboardView** and **ProgressDashboardViewModel**: Added for tracking user progress.\n\n- **New Methods:**\n  - **LoginViewModel**: \n    - `login`: Handles user login.\n    - `forgotPassword`: Manages forgot password logic.\n  - **StudyPlanViewModel**: \n    - `setupStudyPlan`: Sets up the study plan.\n  - **QuestionViewModel**: \n    - `loadQuestions`: Loads questions from the question bank.\n    - `submitAnswer`: Submits the user's answer.\n  - **ProgressDashboardViewModel**: \n    - `fetchProgress`: Fetches user's progress data.\n\n- **New Dependencies:**\n  - Added dependencies for the new views and view models, primarily from the `stacked` and `stacked_services` packages.\n\n#### 2. Removals (\u2796)\n- **Removed Components:**\n  - **HomeView** and **HomeViewModel**: These have been replaced by the new views and view models.\n  - **StartupView** and **StartupViewModel**: These components have been deprecated in favor of the login flow.\n\n- **Removed Methods:**\n  - Various methods from the removed views, including `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` from the HomeViewModel.\n\n- **Removed Dependencies:**\n  - Dependencies related to the old views and services have been eliminated, streamlining the architecture.\n\n#### 3. Changes (\ud83d\udd04)\n- **Modified Interfaces:**\n  - The application structure has been updated to reflect the new authentication flow, starting with the **LoginView** instead of the **StartupView**.\n  - The navigation flow has been altered to include new views: LoginView \u2192 StudyPlanView \u2192 QuestionView \u2192 ProgressDashboardView.\n\n- **Updated Behaviors:**\n  - The state management approach has been refined to utilize new ViewModels, ensuring better separation of concerns and maintainability.\n\n- **Refactored Components:**\n  - The overall architecture has been refactored to enhance maintainability and accommodate new features while ensuring separation of concerns.\n\n- **Dependency Version Changes:**\n  - Updated dependencies to align with the new structure, particularly focusing on `stacked` and `stacked_services`.\n\n### Key Impacts\n- **Breaking Changes:**\n  - The removal of the HomeView and StartupView means that any existing references to these components in the codebase will need to be updated to the new views.\n  - The navigation flow has fundamentally changed, requiring updates to any logic that relies on the previous view structure.\n\n- **Architectural Modifications:**\n  - The introduction of a more modular architecture with distinct responsibilities for each view and view model enhances maintainability but may require developers to adapt to the new structure.\n\n- **Component Structure Changes:**\n  - The folder structure has been reorganized to reflect the new features, necessitating updates in any imports or references to the old structure.\n\n- **Performance Impacts:**\n  - The new architecture may improve performance by reducing the complexity of the state management and enhancing the responsiveness of the UI.\n\n### Required Updates\n- Review and update any code that interacts with the removed views and view models.\n- Adjust navigation logic to accommodate the new flow.\n- Ensure that all dependencies are updated to reflect the new components and methods.\n- Test the application thoroughly to identify any issues arising from the architectural changes.\n\nThis summary provides a clear overview of the significant changes made to the application, highlighting the need for careful updates and testing to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture.",
