    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application has undergone significant architectural changes. The Stacked architecture is still in use, but the focus of the application has shifted from a general-purpose app to a medical study companion app named Aorteq. The app now includes comprehensive authentication flows, exam selection, and study planning features.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nSeveral new components have been added, particularly in the `lib.features.authentication` and `lib.features.study_planning` directories. These include views and view models for authentication, exam selection, and study planning. The `lib.features.app` and `lib.features.startup` directories have been removed, indicating a shift in the application's initial flow.\n\nThe `main.dart` file has been updated to run `WelcomeView` instead of `AppView`, and the `runStartupLogic` method has been replaced with the `main` function. This suggests that the application now starts with an authentication flow.\n\n## API Changes\n\nThe application's package name has been changed from `com.com.walturn.gyde_app` to `com.com.walturn.aorteq_app`. This is a breaking change and will require updates to any external systems that reference the old package name.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nSeveral dependencies have been updated. Notably, the `gap` package has been replaced with `stacked_services` in several files. This could have implications for the application's layout and navigation.\n\n## Removed Components\n\nSeveral methods, including `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet`, have been removed from `lib.features.home.home_viewmodel.dart`. This suggests that these features are no longer part of the application's functionality.\n\n## Security Implications\n\nThe addition of authentication flows suggests an increased focus on security. However, the specifics of the authentication implementation are not detailed in the diff.\n\n## Performance Impacts\n\nThere are no explicit performance-related changes in the diff. However, the addition of new features and dependencies could potentially impact the application's performance.\n\n# Action Items\n\n1. Update any external systems that reference the old package name.\n2. Review the new authentication and study planning flows for usability and security.\n3. Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the removal of methods and dependencies has not introduced any bugs.\n4. Monitor the application's performance, as the addition of new features and dependencies could potentially impact it.\n5. Update any documentation to reflect the new features and architectural changes.",
