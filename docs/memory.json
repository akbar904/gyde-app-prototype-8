    "content": "### Summary of Changes\n\n#### 1. Additions (\u2795)\n- **New Components**:\n  - **Authentication Module**: Added `login_view.dart` and `login_viewmodel.dart` for user authentication.\n  - **Study Plan Module**: Introduced `study_plan_view.dart` and `study_plan_viewmodel.dart` for study plan setup.\n  - **Question Bank Module**: Added `question_view.dart` and `question_viewmodel.dart` to handle question interactions.\n  - **Progress Tracking Module**: Introduced `progress_dashboard_view.dart` and `progress_dashboard_viewmodel.dart` for tracking user progress.\n\n- **New Methods**:\n  - `login`, `forgotPassword` in `LoginViewModel`.\n  - `selectExam`, `selectTopics`, `generateSchedule` in `StudyPlanViewModel`.\n  - `fetchProgress` in `ProgressDashboardViewModel`.\n  - `submitAnswer` in `QuestionViewModel`.\n\n- **New Dependencies**:\n  - Added dependencies for new modules, including `package:stacked/stacked.dart` and `package:stacked_services/stacked_services.dart`.\n\n#### 2. Removals (\u2796)\n- **Removed Components**:\n  - Eliminated the previous `home_view.dart`, `home_viewmodel.dart`, `startup_view.dart`, and `startup_viewmodel.dart`.\n  \n- **Removed Methods**:\n  - Removed methods like `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` from the old `HomeViewModel` and `StartupViewModel`.\n\n- **Deprecated Functionality**:\n  - The previous navigation flow and state management logic have been replaced with a new structure, making the old methods and components obsolete.\n\n#### 3. Changes (\ud83d\udd04)\n- **Architectural Modifications**:\n  - Transitioned from a Stacked architecture with a single app view to a modular architecture with distinct modules for authentication, study planning, question bank, and progress tracking.\n  \n- **Modified Interfaces**:\n  - Updated the main entry point to run the new `App` instead of `AppView`, which now initializes with `LoginView`.\n  - Navigation flow has been restructured to reflect the new user journey through login, study plan setup, question answering, and progress tracking.\n\n- **Updated Behaviors**:\n  - The application now requires user authentication before accessing study planning and question bank features, enhancing security and user management.\n\n- **Dependency Version Changes**:\n  - Dependencies have been updated to reflect the new modular structure, with some packages being replaced or removed.\n\n### Key Impacts\n- **Breaking Changes**:\n  - The removal of old views and view models means existing integrations with these components will break. Developers must update their code to use the new modular components.\n  \n- **Architectural Implications**:\n  - The shift to a modular architecture may improve maintainability and scalability but requires developers to familiarize themselves with the new structure.\n\n- **Security Enhancements**:\n  - The introduction of an authentication module enhances security by ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive features.\n\n- **Performance Considerations**:\n  - The modular approach may lead to improved performance through better separation of concerns, but initial loading times may be affected due to the increased number of modules.\n\n### Required Updates\n- **Code Refactoring**: Update any references to removed views and view models in your codebase.\n- **Integration Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the new authentication flow and modular interactions to ensure functionality.\n- **Documentation Review**: Update any internal documentation to reflect the new architecture and component structure.\n- **Dependency Management**: Review and update any dependency versions in your project to align with the new modules.\n\nThis summary provides a clear overview of the significant changes made to the application, focusing on the architectural shift, new components, and the implications for existing code and functionality.",
