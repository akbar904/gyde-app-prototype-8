    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application's architecture has been changed from Stacked to Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). This change will impact how state management, routing, and dependency injection are handled. The application now incorporates secure storage and API integration.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nSeveral components have been added, removed, and modified:\n\n### Additions\n\n- New views and corresponding view models have been added for authentication, exam selection, and study planning flows. These include `WelcomeView`, `ExamSelectionView`, `StudyPlanView`, and their corresponding view models.\n- New methods for handling Google sign-in (`signInWithGoogle`), navigation to the email authentication screen (`navigateToEmailAuth`), and exam selection (`selectExam`) have been added.\n- A new main file (`lib/main.dart`) has been added as the entry point of the application.\n\n### Removals\n\n- The `StartupView`, `HomeView`, and their corresponding view models have been removed. This implies that the startup logic and home view no longer exist in the application.\n- Several methods, such as `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, `showBottomSheet`, and `runStartupLogic`, have been removed. This indicates a shift in the application's functionality.\n- The `notice_sheet.dart` and `info_alert_dialog.dart` dependencies have been removed, indicating that these UI components are no longer used.\n\n### Changes\n\n- The `AppView` has been replaced with `WelcomeView`, which displays the welcome screen with options for Google sign-in, email login, and sign-up.\n- The `HomeView` has been replaced with `StudyPlanView`, which displays the generated study plan.\n- The `main` method in `lib/main.dart` has been replaced with `generateStudyPlan` in `lib/features/study_plan/study_plan_viewmodel.dart`, which generates a personalized study plan based on user inputs.\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\nSeveral dependencies have been added, removed, and modified:\n\n- The `gap` package has been replaced with `stacked_services` in several files, indicating a shift in how services are managed.\n- The `my_app/ui/bottom_sheets/notice/notice_sheet.dart` dependency has been replaced with `my_app/features/authentication/welcome_view.dart`.\n- The `my_app/ui/dialogs/info_alert/info_alert_dialog.dart` dependency has been replaced with `my_app/features/exam_selection/exam_selection_view.dart`.\n- The `my_app/features/home/home_view.dart` dependency has been replaced with `my_app/features/study_plan/study_plan_view.dart`.\n\n## Other Changes\n\n- The package name has been changed from `com.com.walturn.gyde_app` to `com.com.walturn.aorteq_app`.\n- The project description has been updated to reflect the application's new functionality as a medical study companion app.\n- The navigation flow, sequence diagram, and state management flow have been updated to reflect the new MVVM architecture and the new views and view models.\n\n## Implications\n\nThese changes indicate a significant shift in the application's functionality, architecture, and user interface. Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the MVVM architecture and the new views and view models. They will also need to update any dependencies in their code to match the new ones. The removal of certain methods and views may also require updates to any code that relies on them.",
