    "content": "## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. Additions (\u2795)\n- **New Components:**\n  - **Authentication Features:**\n    - `lib/features/authentication/login_view.dart`: New view for user login.\n    - `lib/features/authentication/login_viewmodel.dart`: ViewModel managing authentication logic.\n  - **Study Plan Features:**\n    - `lib/features/study_plan/study_plan_view.dart`: New view for study plan setup.\n    - `lib/features/study_plan/study_plan_viewmodel.dart`: ViewModel for managing study plan logic.\n  - **Question Bank Features:**\n    - `lib/features/question_bank/question_view.dart`: New view for question bank.\n    - `lib/features/question_bank/question_viewmodel.dart`: ViewModel for question logic.\n    - `lib/features/question_bank/session_analysis_view.dart`: New view for session analysis.\n    - `lib/features/question_bank/session_analysis_viewmodel.dart`: ViewModel for session analysis logic.\n  - **Progress Tracking Features:**\n    - `lib/features/progress_tracking/progress_overview_view.dart`: New view for progress tracking.\n    - `lib/features/progress_tracking/progress_overview_viewmodel.dart`: ViewModel for managing progress tracking logic.\n\n- **New Methods:**\n  - `login`, `forgotPassword` in `LoginViewModel`.\n  - `selectExam`, `selectTopics`, `generateSchedule` in `StudyPlanViewModel`.\n  - `analyzeSession` in `SessionAnalysisViewModel`.\n  - `fetchProgress` in `ProgressOverviewViewModel`.\n  \n- **New Dependencies:**\n  - Added dependencies for new features, including `package:stacked/stacked.dart` and `package:stacked_services/stacked_services.dart`.\n\n### 2. Removals (\u2796)\n- **Removed Components:**\n  - Eliminated `HomeView`, `StartupView`, and their corresponding ViewModels.\n  - Removed methods related to the old home and startup logic (e.g., `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, `runStartupLogic`).\n\n- **Deprecated Functionality:**\n  - The previous navigation flow and state management logic have been replaced with new components focusing on authentication and study planning.\n\n- **Eliminated Dependencies:**\n  - Removed dependencies related to the old structure, such as `package:my_app/features/home/home_view.dart`.\n\n### 3. Changes (\ud83d\udd04)\n- **Modified Interfaces:**\n  - Updated the main application flow to start with `LoginView`, transitioning to `StudyPlanView` upon successful authentication.\n  - Refactored the app structure to accommodate new features, including authentication and study planning.\n\n- **Updated Behaviors:**\n  - The application now requires user authentication before accessing study planning and question bank features.\n\n- **Refactored Components:**\n  - The architecture has been restructured to support new features, leading to significant changes in the component structure and navigation flow.\n\n- **Dependency Version Changes:**\n  - Dependencies have been updated to reflect the new architecture and features.\n\n### Key Areas of Focus\n- **Breaking API Changes:**\n  - The removal of `HomeView` and `StartupView` means any existing references to these components will break. Update any code that relies on these views.\n  \n- **Architectural Modifications:**\n  - The application now follows a more modular approach with distinct features for authentication, study planning, question management, and progress tracking.\n\n- **Component Structure Changes:**\n  - New folder structures have been introduced for `authentication`, `study_plan`, `question_bank`, and `progress_tracking`.\n\n- **Security Implications:**\n  - The introduction of an authentication system enhances security by requiring user credentials for access.\n\n- **Performance Impacts:**\n  - The new architecture may improve performance by streamlining the flow of data and reducing unnecessary dependencies.\n\n### Required Updates\n- Update any references to removed components in your codebase.\n- Ensure that authentication logic is integrated into the user flow.\n- Review and test the new components to ensure they meet the application requirements.\n- Adjust any existing documentation to reflect the new structure and features.\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the changes made to the application, highlighting critical updates and potential impacts on existing functionality.",
