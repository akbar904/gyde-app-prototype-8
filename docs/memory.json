    "content": "## Summary of Changes\n\nThe application has undergone significant changes, primarily focusing on the introduction of an authentication flow and a shift in the initial views presented to the user. \n\n### Additions\n\n1. A new authentication flow has been added to the application, including a splash screen (`SplashView`) and a welcome screen (`WelcomeView`). \n\n2. New dependencies have been added to support the new views: `package:my_app/features/authentication/splash_view.dart` and `package:my_app/features/authentication/welcome_view.dart`.\n\n3. New methods have been introduced in the `SplashViewModel` and `WelcomeViewModel` to handle navigation between the new views. The `navigateToWelcome` method in `SplashViewModel` transitions to the `WelcomeView` after a delay, and the `onGetStarted` method in `WelcomeViewModel` handles the 'Get Started' button press and navigates to the next screen.\n\n4. A new folder structure has been introduced under `lib.features.authentication` to accommodate the new authentication views and their corresponding view models.\n\n### Removals\n\n1. The `StartupView` and its corresponding `StartupViewModel` have been removed, along with their associated methods such as `runStartupLogic`.\n\n2. The `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` methods have been removed from `HomeViewModel`.\n\n3. The `app_view.dart` and `app_viewmodel.dart` files under `lib.features.app` and the `startup_view.dart` and `startup_viewmodel.dart` files under `lib.features.startup` have been removed.\n\n### Changes\n\n1. The application's architecture has been updated to include the new authentication flow. The application now starts with `SplashView` instead of `AppView`, and transitions to `WelcomeView` before navigating to `HomeView`.\n\n2. The `HomeView` and `StartupView` dependencies have been replaced with `SplashView` and `WelcomeView` respectively.\n\n3. The `HomeViewModel` has been updated to include methods for showing a custom dialog and a custom bottom sheet.\n\n4. The project description has been updated to reflect the transformation into a luxury chauffeur service app called Gyde, featuring a dark theme UI, authentication flow, and seamless navigation.\n\n5. The sequence diagram, state management flow, and navigation flow have been updated to reflect the new flow of the application starting from `SplashView` to `WelcomeView` and then to `HomeView`.\n\n### Implications\n\n1. Breaking Changes: The removal of `StartupView` and its corresponding `StartupViewModel`, along with their associated methods, may break existing functionality that depends on these components.\n\n2. Architectural Modifications: The introduction of an authentication flow significantly alters the application's architecture and flow. This will require updates to any documentation or understanding of the application's structure.\n\n3. Component Structure Changes: The addition of new views and their corresponding view models, as well as the removal of existing ones, changes the component structure of the application.\n\n4. Dependency Updates: The addition of new dependencies and the removal of old ones may require updates to the project's dependency management.\n\n5. Performance Impacts: The addition of a delay in the transition from `SplashView` to `WelcomeView` may impact the application's perceived performance.\n\n6. Security Implications: The introduction of an authentication flow may have security implications that need to be addressed, such as secure storage of user credentials and handling of authentication tokens.",
