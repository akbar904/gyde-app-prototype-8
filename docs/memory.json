    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application's architecture has been modified to include an authentication flow. This new flow introduces a splash screen and a welcome page, which are now part of the application's startup sequence.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nSeveral components have been added, removed, or modified:\n\n### Additions\n\n- `SplashView` and `SplashViewModel` have been added to handle the display and logic of the new splash screen.\n- `WelcomeView` and `WelcomeViewModel` have been added for the new welcome page.\n- `navigateToWelcome` method has been added to `SplashViewModel` to handle navigation to the `WelcomeView`.\n- `onGetStarted` method has been added to `WelcomeViewModel` to handle the 'Get Started' button press and navigation to the next view.\n- `StartupView` and `StartupViewModel` have been reintroduced to handle the app's startup logic.\n\n### Removals\n\n- `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` methods have been removed from the `HomeViewModel`.\n- `runStartupLogic` method has been removed from the `StartupViewModel`.\n\n### Changes\n\n- `HomeView` and `HomeViewModel` have been updated to reflect the new navigation flow.\n- `StartupView` and `StartupViewModel` have been updated to handle the app's startup logic.\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\nThe dependencies of several files have been updated to reflect the new components and methods. Notably, the `stacked_services` package has been added as a dependency in several files, indicating a greater reliance on this package for service management.\n\n## Breaking API Changes\n\nThe changes to the application's startup sequence and the addition of the new views and view models constitute breaking changes. Developers will need to update their code to accommodate the new authentication flow and the updated navigation sequence.\n\n## Potential Impacts\n\nThe addition of the authentication flow may impact the user experience, as users will now be required to navigate through the splash screen and welcome page before accessing the main application. The removal of certain methods from the `HomeViewModel` may also impact functionality if these methods were previously used.\n\n## Required Updates\n\nDevelopers will need to familiarize themselves with the new `SplashView`, `SplashViewModel`, `WelcomeView`, and `WelcomeViewModel` components, as well as the updated `HomeView` and `HomeViewModel`. They will also need to understand the new navigation flow and update any code that relies on the old startup sequence. \n\n## Security Implications\n\nNo explicit security implications have been identified in these changes. However, the addition of an authentication flow may have implications for user data handling and should be reviewed for potential security concerns.\n\n## Performance Impacts\n\nThe performance impact of these changes is unclear without further information. However, the addition of new views and the increased reliance on the `stacked_services` package could potentially impact application performance.",
