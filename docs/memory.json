    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application has been restructured to support a luxury chauffeur service app called Gyde. This includes new authentication flows and UI components. The application now starts with a splash screen, followed by a welcome screen, before navigating to the home view.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nSeveral views and view models have been added, removed, or modified:\n\n- The `AppView` has been replaced with `SplashView` as the initial view of the application.\n- `StartupView` and `StartupViewModel` have been removed.\n- New views and view models have been added for the authentication flow: `SplashView`, `SplashViewModel`, `WelcomeView`, and `WelcomeViewModel`.\n- The `HomeView` and `HomeViewModel` have been updated and are now accessed after the authentication flow.\n- The `main.dart` file has been updated to run `SplashView` instead of `AppView`.\n\n## Method Changes\n\nSeveral methods have been added, removed, or modified:\n\n- The `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` methods have been removed from `HomeViewModel`.\n- New methods have been added to `SplashViewModel` and `WelcomeViewModel` to handle the new authentication flow: `navigateToWelcome` and `onGetStarted`.\n- The `showDialog` and `showBottomSheet` methods have been moved to `HomeViewModel`.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nSeveral dependencies have been added, removed, or modified:\n\n- The `gap` package has been replaced with `stacked_services` in `SplashViewModel` and `WelcomeViewModel`.\n- The `stacked_services` package has been replaced with `gap` in `HomeView`.\n- The `app.bottomsheets.dart`, `app.dialogs.dart`, `app.locator.dart`, and `app_view.dart` dependencies have been removed from `main.dart`.\n- The `splash_view.dart` dependency has been added to `main.dart`.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nThe changes to the views, view models, and methods will require updates to any code that uses these components. The new authentication flow will also require updates to any code that relies on the previous startup flow.\n\n## Potential Impacts\n\nThe new authentication flow and UI components may impact user experience and require updates to user documentation. The changes to dependencies may also impact compatibility with other packages or components.\n\n## Required Updates\n\nDevelopers will need to update any code that uses the removed or modified views, view models, methods, or dependencies. They will also need to implement the new authentication flow in their code.",
