    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application has transitioned from a Stacked architecture to a modular architecture. This change enhances scalability and ensures separation of concerns by dedicating views and viewmodels to each feature. The features now include authentication, study plan setup, question bank, and progress tracking.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nThe `gap` dependency, previously used for creating gaps in layouts, has been replaced with `provider` for state management. The version of the `provider` package has been updated from `^2.0.0` to `^5.0.0`. This change implies a shift in the state management strategy, which now uses a scalable solution like Provider or Riverpod.\n\n## File Structure and Component Changes\n\nThe file structure has been reorganized to align with the new modular architecture. The application now includes separate folders for each feature (authentication, study plan, question bank, progress tracking) instead of the previous structure (app setup, features, UI components, utilities).\n\nThe `AppView` and `StartupView` have been replaced with `LoginView`, `StudyPlanView`, `QuestionView`, and `ProgressView`. These changes reflect the new features introduced in the application.\n\nThe corresponding ViewModel files have also been added for each view, managing the business logic and state for their respective views.\n\n## Method Changes\n\nSeveral methods have been added, removed, or modified across different files. Notably, the `login` method in `login_viewmodel.dart` and the `setupStudyPlan` method in `study_plan_viewmodel.dart` have been added. These methods handle user login logic and study plan setup, respectively.\n\n## Navigation Flow Changes\n\nThe navigation flow has been updated to start with `LoginView` and proceed to `StudyPlanView`, `QuestionView`, and finally `ProgressView` upon successful authentication, study plan setup, and question answering.\n\n## Package Name Change\n\nThe package name has been updated from `com.com.walturn.gyde_app` to `com.com.walturn.aorteq_app`.\n\n## Project Description Update\n\nThe project description has been updated to reflect the new features and focus of the application. The application is now described as a web-based USMLE Step 1 study companion called AorteQ, featuring an authentication system, initial study plan setup, question bank interface, and progress tracking dashboard.\n\n## Sequence Diagram Update\n\nThe sequence diagram has been updated to reflect the new navigation flow and interactions between the user and the application's views and viewmodels.\n\n## State Management Flow Update\n\nThe state management flow has been updated to reflect the use of Provider or Riverpod for state management. The ViewModels now handle the business logic and state for their respective views, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.\n\n## Action Items\n\nDevelopers should familiarize themselves with the new modular architecture and the Provider or Riverpod state management solutions. They should update their local environments to include the new `provider` dependency and remove the deprecated `gap` dependency. They should also adjust their code to align with the new file structure and component changes, and update their navigation logic to align with the new navigation flow.",
