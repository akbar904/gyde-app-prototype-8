    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application architecture has been updated from a Stacked architecture to a Stacked Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This change introduces ViewModels that handle business logic and state management, enhancing the separation of concerns in the application.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nThe application's structure has been significantly reorganized. The previous `AppView` and `StartupView` have been replaced with a new `SplashView` and `WelcomeView`, respectively. The `HomeView` has been moved to a new location in the file structure. \n\nNew components have been added for authentication (`PhoneVerificationView`, `EmailVerificationView`, `TermsView`), profile setup (`ModeSelectionView`, `ProfileInformationView`, `PackageSelectionView`, `PaymentMethodView`, `NotificationPermissionView`), and booking (`OneWayBookingView`, `MultiStopBookingView`, `HourlyBookingView`). \n\nThe `HomeViewModel` remains, but the `StartupViewModel` has been removed. \n\n## API Changes\n\nThe application's public interfaces have been significantly altered. Several methods have been removed, including `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, `showBottomSheet`, and `runStartupLogic`. \n\nThe application's entry point has been changed from `AppView` to `SplashView`. This change will require updates to any external code that interacts with the application's entry point.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nThe application's dependencies have been updated. The `gap` package has been replaced with `stacked_services` in several files. Several dependencies have been removed from `main.dart`, including `app.bottomsheets.dart`, `app.dialogs.dart`, `app.locator.dart`, and `app_view.dart`.\n\n## Potential Impacts\n\nThese changes introduce a more robust and scalable architecture for the application. However, they also introduce potential breaking changes for any code that interacts with the removed or altered components, methods, or dependencies. \n\nDevelopers will need to update any code that interacts with these elements to align with the new architecture and APIs. \n\n## Security, Performance, and Other Considerations\n\nThe changes do not appear to introduce any new security vulnerabilities or performance impacts. However, the new architecture and components should be thoroughly tested to ensure they function as expected and do not introduce any new issues. \n\nThe addition of authentication and profile setup components suggests a shift in the application's functionality towards a more personalized user experience. This change may have implications for user data privacy and should be reviewed for compliance with relevant regulations.",
