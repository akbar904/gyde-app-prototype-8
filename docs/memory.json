    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application has transitioned from a Stacked architecture to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This change emphasizes modularity and reusability, which could potentially improve maintainability and testability of the codebase.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nThe application's component structure has been significantly reorganized. The previous `AppView`, `HomeView`, and `StartupView` components have been replaced with `WelcomeView`, `ExamSelectionView`, and `StudyPlanView` respectively. This indicates a shift in the application's primary features, moving from a generic app structure to a more specialized medical study companion app.\n\n## Additions\n\nNew methods have been added to handle Google authentication (`continueWithGoogle`) and navigation to the email authentication screen (`loginWithEmail`). Additionally, a method for handling exam selection logic (`selectExam`) and generating a personalized study plan (`generateStudyPlan`) have been introduced.\n\nNew folders have been added for `authentication`, `exam_selection`, and `study_plan` features, indicating the introduction of new functionalities in the application.\n\n## Removals\n\nSeveral methods such as `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` have been removed, indicating a shift away from the previous functionalities. \n\nThe `notice_sheet.dart` and `info_alert_dialog.dart` dependencies have been removed, suggesting that the application no longer uses these UI components.\n\nThe `home` and `startup` features have been removed from the folder structure, indicating a significant change in the application's primary functionalities.\n\n## Changes\n\nThe application's dependencies have been updated, with several dependencies being replaced. For example, `gap.dart` has been replaced with `stacked_services.dart`. This could potentially impact the application's behavior and may require updates in the dependent code.\n\nThe application's package name has been changed from `com.com.walturn.gyde_app` to `com.com.walturn.aorteq_app`, which may require updates in the application's configuration and distribution settings.\n\nThe application's description has been updated to reflect its new purpose as a medical study companion app.\n\n## Implications\n\nThese changes indicate a significant shift in the application's functionalities and architecture. Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the MVVM architecture and the new component structure. \n\nThe removal of certain methods and dependencies may break existing functionalities, and the addition of new methods and dependencies may require updates in the dependent code.\n\nThe change in package name will require updates in the application's configuration and distribution settings. \n\nThe transition to a more specialized application could potentially impact the user base, as the application now targets a more specific audience. \n\nOverall, these changes suggest a major version update due to the breaking changes introduced.",
