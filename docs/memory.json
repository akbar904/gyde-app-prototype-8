    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application's architecture has been modified to include a ViewModel for each view to handle business logic and state. This change enhances the separation of concerns and improves code maintainability.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nSeveral components have been added, removed, and modified:\n\n### Additions\n\nNew components have been added to the `features/authentication`, `features/booking`, and `features/profile_setup` directories. These components include various views and viewmodels for authentication, booking, and profile setup functionalities.\n\nA new method `initialize` has been added to the `SplashViewModel`. This method handles the initialization logic for the splash screen.\n\nA new method `loadChauffeurDetails` has been added to the `HomeViewModel`. This method loads the details of the featured chauffeur.\n\n### Removals\n\nThe `features/startup` directory and its components have been removed, indicating a change in the startup logic of the application.\n\nThe methods `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` have been removed from the `HomeViewModel`. This suggests a change in the home view's functionality.\n\n### Modifications\n\nThe `AppView` has been replaced with `SplashView` as the root widget of the application. This change indicates a new splash screen feature.\n\nThe `HomeView` and `HomeViewModel` have been updated to include service categories and featured chauffeur details.\n\nThe `StartupView` and `StartupViewModel` have been replaced with `HomeView` and `HomeViewModel`, indicating a change in the application's startup flow.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nThe dependencies of several files have been updated. Notably, the `gap` package has been replaced with the `stacked_services` package in several files. This change suggests a shift in the way services are managed in the application.\n\n## Other Changes\n\nThe project description has been updated to reflect the application's new features, including authentication, profile setup, booking flows, and a dark theme UI.\n\nThe navigation flow has been updated to start with `main.dart`, which sets up the app and runs `SplashView`. After completing the initialization logic, it navigates to the `HomeView`.\n\nThe sequence diagram has been updated to reflect the new flow of interactions between the user, the views, and the viewmodels.\n\n## Implications\n\nThese changes indicate a significant overhaul of the application's structure and functionality. Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the new architecture and component structure.\n\nThe removal of certain methods and components may break existing functionality. Developers will need to ensure that these functionalities are either no longer needed or have been implemented elsewhere.\n\nThe addition of new components and dependencies may introduce new potential points of failure. Rigorous testing will be required to ensure the application's stability and performance.\n\nThe changes in dependencies may also have security implications. The new dependencies should be reviewed for potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nOverall, these changes represent a significant update to the application. Developers will need to carefully review the changes and update their code accordingly.",
