    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe architecture of the application remains the same, following the Stacked architecture. However, a significant change is the addition of a ViewModel for each view to handle business logic and state management.\n\n## Dependencies\nThere have been several changes in the dependencies of the files. Notably, the dependency `package:my_app/features/home/home_view.dart` has been changed to `package:my_app/features/authentication/splash_view.dart`. Similarly, `package:my_app/features/startup/startup_view.dart` has been updated to `package:my_app/features/home/home_view.dart`.\n\n## File Descriptions\nThe descriptions of the files have been updated to reflect the new functionalities added to the application. For instance, the description of `files[0]` has been updated to include routes for authentication, profile setup, home, and booking views.\n\n## Class Diagrams\nThe class diagrams have been updated to reflect the new classes added to the application. For example, `AppView` has been replaced with `SplashView`.\n\n## Methods\nNew methods have been added to the files, such as the `initialize` method in `files[2]` and the `navigateToAuthOptions` method in `files[4]`.\n\n## New Files\nSeveral new files have been added to the application, including `email_verification_view.dart`, `email_verification_viewmodel.dart`, `terms_view.dart`, `terms_viewmodel.dart`, and many more. These files introduce new functionalities such as email verification, terms acceptance, and profile setup.\n\n## Folder Structure\nThe folder structure of the application has been updated. The `lib.features.app` folder has been removed, and new folders such as `lib.features.authentication`, `lib.features.booking`, and `lib.features.profile_setup` have been added.\n\n## Navigation Flow\nThe navigation flow of the application has been updated to include the new views added to the application. The application now starts with `main.dart`, which sets up the app and runs `SplashView`.\n\n## Project Description\nThe project description has been updated to reflect the transformation of the application into a luxury chauffeur service app called Gyde.\n\n## Sequence Diagram\nThe sequence diagram has been updated to include the new views and their interactions with the user.\n\n## State Management Flow\nThe state management flow remains the same, with the Stacked architecture being used for state management. However, each ViewModel is now responsible for managing the state and logic of its corresponding view, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.\n\n# Implications\nThese changes introduce new functionalities to the application and improve its structure and organization. However, they may also require updates to existing code that interacts with the modified components. Developers should review the changes carefully to understand their impact on the application.",
