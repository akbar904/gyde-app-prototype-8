    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe application architecture remains the Stacked architecture, but now each view has a corresponding ViewModel to handle business logic and state.\n\n## Dependencies\nSeveral dependencies have been updated. Notably, the `home_view.dart` has been replaced with `authentication/splash_view.dart` and `startup_view.dart` has been replaced with `home/home_view.dart`.\n\n## File Descriptions\nFile descriptions have been updated to reflect the new functionalities. For example, the file that previously defined the root widget of the application now describes a splash screen showing a luxury car interior and chauffeur.\n\n## Class Diagrams\nClass diagrams have been updated to reflect the new classes introduced in the application.\n\n## Methods\nSeveral new methods have been added, such as `initialize` in `splash_viewmodel.dart`, `navigateToAuthOptions` in `welcome_viewmodel.dart`, `verifyPhoneNumber` and `submitVerificationCode` in `phone_verification_viewmodel.dart`, and more. These methods handle various functionalities such as initializing the splash screen, navigating to authentication options, verifying phone numbers, and submitting verification codes.\n\n## New Files\nNumerous new files have been added to handle authentication, profile setup, booking, and home view. These include `email_collection_view.dart`, `email_collection_viewmodel.dart`, `terms_view.dart`, `terms_viewmodel.dart`, `mode_selection_view.dart`, `mode_selection_viewmodel.dart`, `profile_information_view.dart`, `profile_information_viewmodel.dart`, `package_selection_view.dart`, `package_selection_viewmodel.dart`, `payment_method_view.dart`, `payment_method_viewmodel.dart`, `notification_permission_view.dart`, `notification_permission_viewmodel.dart`, `home_view.dart`, `home_viewmodel.dart`, `one_way_booking_view.dart`, `one_way_booking_viewmodel.dart`, `multi_stop_booking_view.dart`, `multi_stop_booking_viewmodel.dart`, `hourly_booking_view.dart`, `hourly_booking_viewmodel.dart`.\n\n## Folder Structure\nThe folder structure has been updated to accommodate the new files and functionalities. The `app` folder has been removed and replaced with `authentication`, `booking`, and `profile_setup` folders.\n\n## Navigation Flow\nThe navigation flow has been updated. The application now starts with `main.dart`, which sets up the app and runs `SplashView`. `SplashView` initializes the Stacked architecture and navigates to `WelcomeView`. The authentication flow proceeds through phone verification and email collection, leading to the home view.\n\n## Project Description\nThe project description has been updated to reflect the transformation of the application into a luxury chauffeur service app called Gyde, featuring authentication, profile setup, booking management, and a dark theme UI using the Stacked architecture.\n\n## Sequence Diagram\nThe sequence diagram has been updated to reflect the new user flow from launching the app to interacting with the home view.\n\n## State Management Flow\nThe state management flow has been updated. State is now managed using the Stacked architecture with dedicated ViewModels for each user flow, such as authentication and booking.\n\n# Implications\nThese changes indicate a significant shift in the application's functionality, moving from a simple app structure to a more complex luxury chauffeur service app. Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the new files, methods, and dependencies. The updated navigation flow and state management flow will also require understanding. The addition of new functionalities such as authentication, profile setup, and booking management may have implications for security and performance, which should be thoroughly tested.",
