    "content": "## Summary of Changes\n\n### Architectural Changes\nThe application architecture has been changed from Stacked to Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). This change affects state management, routing, and dependency injection, which now use ViewModels. The application now includes authentication, exam selection, and study planning flows.\n\n### Component Structure Changes\nThe root widget of the application has been changed from `AppView` to `WelcomeView`, which is the welcome screen for the authentication flow. The main home view of the application has been replaced with `WelcomeViewModel`, which manages state and logic for user authentication options. \n\nThe `HomeView` and `StartupView` have been replaced with `ExamSelectionView` and `StudyPlanView` respectively. The `HomeViewModel` and `StartupViewModel` have been replaced with `ExamSelectionViewModel` and `StudyPlanViewModel` respectively. \n\nThe `main.dart` file, which was the entry point of the application, has been replaced with `StudyPlanViewModel`. A new `main.dart` file has been added, which sets up the app and runs `WelcomeView`.\n\n### Additions\nNew folders for authentication, exam selection, and study planning have been added to the project structure. These folders contain view and ViewModel files for each flow. \n\nA new dependency `package:my_app/features/study_plan/study_plan_view.dart` has been added.\n\n### Removals\nThe `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` methods have been removed from the `HomeViewModel`. The `runStartupLogic` method has been removed from the `StartupViewModel`. \n\nThe `main` method has been removed from the `main.dart` file. \n\nSeveral dependencies have been removed from the `main.dart` file, including `package:my_app/app/app.bottomsheets.dart`, `package:my_app/app/app.dialogs.dart`, `package:my_app/app/app.locator.dart`, and `package:my_app/features/app/app_view.dart`.\n\nThe `lib.features.app`, `lib.features.home`, and `lib.features.startup` folders have been removed from the project structure.\n\n### Changes\nThe dependencies of several files have been updated. For example, `package:gap/gap.dart` has been replaced with `package:stacked_services/stacked_services.dart` in `WelcomeViewModel` and `ExamSelectionViewModel`.\n\nThe package name has been changed from `com.com.walturn.gyde_app` to `com.com.walturn.aorteq_app`.\n\nThe project description has been updated to reflect the transformation into a medical study companion app called Aorteq.\n\nThe sequence diagram and navigation flow have been updated to reflect the new application flow, starting with user authentication, followed by exam selection and study planning.\n\n### Implications\nThese changes represent a significant refactoring of the application, with potential impacts on existing functionality and dependencies. Developers will need to familiarize themselves with the MVVM architecture and the new project structure. Existing tests may need to be updated or replaced to match the new architecture and components. \n\nThere are no immediate security implications, but the new authentication flow should be thoroughly tested for potential vulnerabilities. \n\nThe performance impact of these changes is unclear without further testing, but the use of ViewModels for state management could potentially improve responsiveness and scalability.",
