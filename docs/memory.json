    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\nThe application's architecture has been significantly modified. The application now follows the Stacked architecture with each view having a corresponding ViewModel to handle business logic and state. This change enhances the separation of concerns and improves the maintainability of the codebase.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\nSeveral changes have been made to the component structure of the application:\n\n### Additions:\n- New authentication, profile setup, and booking flows have been added to the application. These include `SplashView`, `WelcomeView`, `OneWayBookingView`, `MultiStopBookingView`, and `HourlyBookingView`, among others. Each of these views has a corresponding ViewModel.\n- A new `initialize` method has been added to the `SplashViewModel`. This method handles the initialization logic of the splash screen and navigates to the welcome view.\n- A new `loadChauffeurDetails` method has been added to the `HomeViewModel`. This method loads the details of the featured chauffeur.\n\n### Removals:\n- The `StartupView` and `StartupViewModel` have been removed from the application. The startup logic is now handled by the `SplashView` and `SplashViewModel`.\n- The `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` methods have been removed from the `HomeViewModel`.\n\n### Changes:\n- The `HomeView` and `HomeViewModel` have been updated. The `HomeView` now shows service categories and a featured chauffeur, and the `HomeViewModel` manages the state and business logic.\n- The `main` method in `main.dart` now sets up the app and runs `SplashView` instead of `AppView`.\n\n## Dependency Updates\nThe dependencies of several files have been updated. Notably, the `gap` package has been replaced with the `stacked_services` package in `SplashViewModel` and `HomeView`. The `stacked_services` package provides a set of services for managing dialogs, bottom sheets, and navigation in a Stacked architecture.\n\n## Breaking API Changes\nThe removal of the `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet` methods from the `HomeViewModel` may break any existing code that relies on these methods. Developers will need to update their code to reflect these changes.\n\n## Potential Impacts\nThe architectural changes and component structure changes may require developers to familiarize themselves with the new structure and flow of the application. The removal of methods and views may also require updates to existing code. However, these changes should improve the maintainability and scalability of the application.\n\n## Security Implications\nNo direct security implications have been identified from these changes. However, the addition of new authentication flows should be thoroughly tested to ensure they handle user data securely.\n\n## Performance Impacts\nNo direct performance impacts have been identified from these changes. However, the addition of new views and ViewModels may have an impact on the application's performance and should be tested.",
