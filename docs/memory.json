    "content": "### Summary of Changes\n\n#### 1. Additions (\u2795)\n- **New Components**:\n  - **Authentication**: `login_view.dart`, `login_viewmodel.dart`\n  - **Study Plan**: `study_plan_wizard_view.dart`, `study_plan_wizard_viewmodel.dart`\n  - **Question Bank**: `question_view.dart`, `question_viewmodel.dart`, `session_analysis_dashboard_view.dart`, `session_analysis_dashboard_viewmodel.dart`\n  - **Progress Tracking**: `progress_tracking_dashboard_view.dart`, `progress_tracking_dashboard_viewmodel.dart`\n  \n- **New Methods**:\n  - `login()`: Handles user login logic in `LoginViewModel`.\n  - `forgotPassword()`: Manages forgot password logic in `LoginViewModel`.\n  - `nextStep()`, `previousStep()`: Navigation methods in `StudyPlanWizardViewModel`.\n  - `calculateMetrics()`: Calculates performance metrics in `SessionAnalysisDashboardViewModel`.\n  - `updateProgress()`: Updates user progress metrics in `ProgressTrackingDashboardViewModel`.\n  \n- **New Dependencies**:\n  - Added dependencies for new features, primarily from `stacked` and `stacked_services`.\n\n#### 2. Removals (\u2796)\n- **Removed Components**:\n  - Deprecated `app_view.dart` and `app_viewmodel.dart` as part of the restructuring.\n  \n- **Removed Methods**:\n  - Methods related to the old `HomeViewModel` and `StartupViewModel` such as `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, and `showBottomSheet`.\n  \n- **Removed Dependencies**:\n  - Eliminated several dependencies from `main.dart` that were no longer needed after restructuring.\n\n#### 3. Changes (\ud83d\udd04)\n- **Modified Interfaces**:\n  - Updated the application structure to reflect new views and view models, including renaming and relocating files.\n  - Changed navigation flow to start with `LoginView` instead of `HomeView`, impacting user experience and flow.\n  \n- **Updated Behaviors**:\n  - The application now requires user authentication before accessing the study plan and question views, enhancing security.\n  \n- **Refactored Components**:\n  - Significant refactoring of view models to align with new features and functionalities, including the introduction of new view models for authentication and progress tracking.\n  \n- **Dependency Version Changes**:\n  - Updated dependencies to ensure compatibility with new features and improved functionality.\n\n### Key Areas of Focus\n- **Breaking API Changes**:\n  - The removal of old view models and methods may break existing integrations or functionalities relying on them.\n  \n- **Architectural Modifications**:\n  - The introduction of new folders for features indicates a shift towards a more modular architecture, improving maintainability.\n  \n- **Component Structure Changes**:\n  - The restructuring of files and folders may require updates to import paths in existing codebases.\n  \n- **Security Implications**:\n  - The addition of an authentication system enhances security but requires users to manage credentials.\n  \n- **Performance Impacts**:\n  - The new architecture and dependencies may improve performance, but thorough testing is needed to ensure no regressions occur.\n\n### Required Updates\n- **Codebase Adjustments**:\n  - Update import paths and references to removed or renamed components in the codebase.\n  \n- **Testing**:\n  - Comprehensive testing of the new authentication flow and view transitions is essential to ensure a smooth user experience.\n  \n- **Documentation**:\n  - Update technical documentation to reflect new components, methods, and architectural changes for future reference.\n\nThis summary provides a clear overview of the significant changes made to the application, highlighting critical areas that developers and stakeholders need to address moving forward.",
