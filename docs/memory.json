    "content": "## Summary of Changes\n\nThe application has undergone significant changes, expanding its functionality and introducing new flows for authentication, profile setup, and booking. The application now includes a luxury chauffeur service called Gyde with a dark theme UI.\n\n### Additions\n\n1. **New Flows**: The application now includes comprehensive flows for authentication, profile setup, and booking. These flows include screens for splash, welcome, phone verification, email collection, terms acceptance, mode selection, profile information input, package selection, payment method selection, and notification permission.\n\n2. **New Dependencies**: New dependencies have been added to various files, primarily the `stacked` package for state management.\n\n3. **New Components**: Numerous new components have been added to handle the new flows, including `SplashView`, `WelcomeView`, `PhoneVerificationView`, `EmailCollectionView`, `TermsView`, `ModeSelectionView`, `ProfileInformationView`, `PackageSelectionView`, `PaymentMethodView`, `NotificationPermissionView`, `OneWayBookingView`, `MultiStopBookingView`, and `HourlyBookingView`, along with their corresponding ViewModels.\n\n### Removals\n\n1. **Removed Components**: The `AppView`, `StartupView`, and their corresponding ViewModels have been removed.\n\n2. **Removed Methods**: Several methods such as `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, `showBottomSheet`, and `runStartupLogic` have been removed, indicating a shift in the application's functionality.\n\n3. **Removed Dependencies**: Some dependencies like `gap` and `stacked_services` have been removed from various files.\n\n### Changes\n\n1. **Modified Interfaces**: Many files have been renamed and their descriptions updated to reflect the new functionality. For instance, `home_view.dart` has been renamed to `splash_view.dart` and its description updated to \"Splash screen showing luxury car interior and chauffeur.\"\n\n2. **Updated Behaviors**: The application's navigation flow has been updated to accommodate the new authentication and profile setup flows. The application now starts with a splash screen and transitions through the new flows before reaching the home view.\n\n3. **Refactored Components**: The `main.dart` file has been updated to run `SplashView` instead of `AppView`. The `main.dart` file's dependencies have also been updated accordingly.\n\n### Impacts\n\n1. **Breaking Changes**: The removal of components like `AppView` and `StartupView` and their corresponding ViewModels may break existing functionality that relies on these components.\n\n2. **Required Updates**: Due to the significant changes in the application's structure and functionality, updates will be required in any dependent code to accommodate the new components and flows.\n\n3. **Performance Impacts**: The addition of new flows and components may have an impact on the application's performance. This should be tested and optimized as necessary.\n\n4. **Security Implications**: The new authentication flow introduces potential security considerations that should be thoroughly reviewed and tested.\n\nIn conclusion, these changes transform the application into a comprehensive luxury chauffeur service app, introducing new flows for authentication, profile setup, and booking. Developers should review these changes carefully and update any dependent code accordingly.",
