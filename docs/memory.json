    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architecture Changes\n\nThe application has transitioned from a Stacked architecture to a modular architecture. The new structure includes separate folders for app setup, authentication, study plan, question bank, and progress tracking. This change enhances the separation of concerns and makes the application more maintainable.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nThe application has undergone significant restructuring. The previous components (HomeView, StartupView) have been replaced with new components (LoginView, StudyPlanView, QuestionView, ProgressView). These changes reflect the new functionalities of the application, such as user authentication, study plan setup, question bank interface, and progress tracking dashboard.\n\n## Method Changes\n\nSeveral new methods have been introduced to handle the new functionalities. These include methods for handling login with email/password and social login options, managing study plan setup, answering questions, and tracking progress. Some methods from the previous version, such as `incrementCounter`, `showDialog`, `showBottomSheet`, and `runStartupLogic`, have been removed as they are no longer relevant to the new functionalities.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nThe dependency \"gap\" has been removed from the project. This might affect the layout of the application if it was previously used for creating gaps in layouts. The dependencies in the files have been updated to reflect the new structure and functionalities of the application. \n\n## Navigation Flow Changes\n\nThe navigation flow of the application has been updated. The application now starts with the LoginView, navigates to the StudyPlanView upon successful authentication, then to the QuestionView after setting up the study plan, and finally to the ProgressView upon completing a session.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nThe changes in the component structure, methods, and navigation flow might break existing functionalities if not properly handled. The removal of the \"gap\" dependency might also affect the layout of the application.\n\n## Required Updates\n\nTo adapt to these changes, developers will need to update their code to use the new components, methods, and navigation flow. They will also need to handle the removal of the \"gap\" dependency in their layout code.\n\n## Security Implications\n\nThe introduction of user authentication enhances the security of the application by ensuring that only authenticated users can access the application's functionalities.\n\n## Performance Impacts\n\nThe modular architecture and the new functionalities might impact the performance of the application. However, the impact is expected to be minimal as the Stacked architecture, which is known for its performance efficiency, is still being used for state management, routing, and dependency injection.",
