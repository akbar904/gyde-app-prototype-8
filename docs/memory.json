    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application has transitioned from a Stacked architecture to an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. This change impacts the overall structure of the application and the way state management is handled. The application now includes authentication flows, exam selection, and study planning features.\n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\n### Additions\n\nNew components have been added to the application, including `WelcomeView`, `WelcomeViewModel`, `ExamSelectionView`, and `ExamSelectionViewModel`. These components are part of the new authentication and study planning features.\n\nNew methods have been added to the `WelcomeViewModel` and `ExamSelectionViewModel` to handle user interactions on the welcome screen and manage the state and logic for exam selection, respectively.\n\nNew folders have been added to the project structure for the authentication (`lib.features.authentication`) and study planning (`lib.features.study_planning`) features.\n\n### Removals\n\nSeveral components have been removed from the application, including `AppView`, `HomeView`, `HomeViewModel`, `StartupView`, and `StartupViewModel`. These components were part of the previous Stacked architecture and are no longer needed in the new MVVM architecture.\n\nThe `lib.features.app`, `lib.features.home`, `lib.features.startup`, `lib.ui.bottom_sheets`, and `lib.ui.dialogs` folders have been removed from the project structure.\n\n### Changes\n\nThe `main.dart` file has been updated to set up and run the `WelcomeView` instead of the `AppView`. The `main` method now runs the app instead of the `runStartupLogic` method.\n\nThe `files[0].dependencies` have been updated to reflect the new components and dependencies in the application.\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\nSeveral dependencies have been added to the `main.dart` file, including `app.bottomsheets.dart`, `app.dialogs.dart`, `app.locator.dart`, and `welcome_view.dart`.\n\nThe dependencies in `files[2]` and `files[4]` have been updated from `gap.dart` to `stacked_services.dart`.\n\n## Breaking API Changes\n\nThe transition from the Stacked architecture to the MVVM architecture represents a significant change in the application's structure and behavior. This change may break existing functionality and require updates to any code that interacts with the application's public interfaces.\n\n## Potential Impacts\n\nThe architectural change to MVVM may improve the separation of concerns in the application and make the code easier to maintain and test. However, it may also require additional training for developers who are not familiar with the MVVM architecture.\n\nThe addition of authentication and study planning features may enhance the functionality of the application but could also introduce new security considerations.\n\nThe removal of components and dependencies may impact any code that relies on these elements. It may also reduce the complexity and size of the application.\n\nThe changes to the `main.dart` file and the `files[0].dependencies` may affect the startup behavior of the application and the way dependencies are managed.\n\n## Required Updates\n\nDevelopers will need to update any code that interacts with the removed components or relies on the previous Stacked architecture. They will also need to familiarize themselves with the new MVVM architecture and the added authentication and study planning features.",
