    "content": "# Summary of Changes\n\n## Architectural Changes\n\nThe application has transitioned from a Stacked architecture to an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. This change emphasizes modularity and maintainability, with separate folders for app setup, features, UI components, and utilities. \n\n## Component Structure Changes\n\nSeveral components have been removed, added, or modified:\n\n### Removed Components\n- `HomeView` and `StartupView` have been removed, along with their corresponding ViewModels.\n- The `NoticeSheet` and `InfoAlertDialog` have also been removed.\n\n### Added Components\n- New components have been introduced for the authentication and study planning flows. These include `WelcomeView`, `ExamSelectionView`, and their corresponding ViewModels.\n- New folders have been added for authentication and study planning features.\n\n### Modified Components\n- The `AppView` has been replaced by `WelcomeView`, which serves as the entry point for the authentication flow.\n- The `main.dart` file now sets up the app and runs `WelcomeView`.\n\n## Dependency Changes\n\nSeveral dependencies have been updated:\n\n- Dependencies on `notice_sheet.dart` and `info_alert_dialog.dart` have been removed.\n- New dependencies have been added for the `WelcomeView` and `ExamSelectionView`.\n\n## Navigation Flow Changes\n\nThe navigation flow has been updated to accommodate the new authentication and study planning flows. The application now starts with `main.dart`, which runs `WelcomeView`. After user authentication, it navigates to the `ExamSelectionView`.\n\n## State Management Changes\n\nState management has been updated to align with the MVVM architecture. ViewModels now handle the business logic and state for their respective views.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nThe transition to MVVM architecture and the introduction of new components and dependencies may require updates to existing code that interacts with the modified components. The removal of certain components may also break existing functionality if not properly addressed.\n\n## Action Items\n\n- Update any code that interacts with the modified components to align with the new architecture and component structure.\n- Replace any functionality dependent on the removed components with the new components.\n- Update the state management logic to align with the MVVM architecture.\n- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the new components and dependencies function as expected and do not introduce new issues.",
