    "content": "### Summary of Changes\n\nThis summary outlines significant modifications to the architecture, dependencies, and components of the application, focusing on the transition to a more structured and feature-rich design. \n\n---\n\n#### 1. Additions (\u2795)\n\n- **New Components:**\n  - **Authentication Features:**\n    - `login_view.dart`, `login_viewmodel.dart`, and `auth_repository.dart` added to handle user authentication.\n  - **Study Plan Features:**\n    - `study_plan_view.dart`, `study_plan_viewmodel.dart`, and `study_plan_repository.dart` introduced for managing study plans.\n  - **Progress Tracking:**\n    - `progress_dashboard_view.dart` and `progress_dashboard_viewmodel.dart` added for tracking user progress.\n  - **Question Bank:**\n    - `question_view.dart`, `question_viewmodel.dart`, and `question_repository.dart` added for managing questions.\n\n- **New Methods:**\n  - `login`, `signInWithGoogle`, and `signInWithApple` methods in the `LoginViewModel`.\n  - `setExamDate`, `selectTopics`, and `generateStudySchedule` methods in the `StudyPlanViewModel`.\n  - `loadQuestions` and `selectAnswer` methods in the `QuestionViewModel`.\n  - `fetchQuestions` method in the `QuestionRepository`.\n\n- **New Dependencies:**\n  - Added `cloud_firestore` for data storage.\n  - Updated `firebase_auth` for user authentication.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Removals (\u2796)\n\n- **Removed Components:**\n  - The `home_view.dart` and `home_viewmodel.dart` have been eliminated in favor of the new authentication and study plan structures.\n  - The `startup_view.dart` and `startup_viewmodel.dart` have been removed as their functionality has been integrated into the new login and study plan features.\n\n- **Removed Dependencies:**\n  - The `gap` package is still present but is no longer the primary focus for layout management.\n  - Several dependencies related to the old structure have been removed from `main.dart`.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Changes (\ud83d\udd04)\n\n- **Architectural Modifications:**\n  - The application now follows a more modular structure with dedicated folders for authentication, study plan, progress tracking, and question bank features.\n  - The main entry point now initializes the `LoginView` instead of the `StartupView`, reflecting a shift to user authentication as the first step.\n\n- **Modified Interfaces:**\n  - The `AppView` now shows the `LoginView` first, and upon successful login, it navigates to the `StudyPlanView`.\n  - Updated class diagrams and descriptions to reflect the new architecture and functionalities.\n\n- **Dependency Version Changes:**\n  - `firebase_auth` updated from `^2.0.0` to `^3.3.0`.\n  - New dependency `cloud_firestore` added at version `^3.1.0`.\n\n- **Behavioral Changes:**\n  - The navigation flow has been altered to prioritize user authentication before accessing study plans and questions.\n  - State management now utilizes new ViewModels for each feature, improving separation of concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Key Impacts\n\n- **Breaking Changes:**\n  - The removal of the `home_view` and `startup_view` means that any existing references to these components will break. Developers must update their code to use the new authentication and study plan features.\n  - Changes in method names and signatures in the ViewModels may require updates in the calling code.\n\n- **Required Updates:**\n  - Update any references to removed components in the application.\n  - Ensure that the new dependencies are included in the project configuration.\n  - Review and adapt to the new navigation flow and state management practices.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThese changes represent a significant evolution in the application's architecture, focusing on user authentication and study management. Developers should prioritize updating their implementations to align with the new structure and take advantage of the enhanced features.",
